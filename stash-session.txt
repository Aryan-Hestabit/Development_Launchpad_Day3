Development Launchpad Day 3
Task 4

This session demonstrates the the workflow of stash command of Git

---

Step 1: Made Temporary changes in the commits.txt
---

Step 2: Stash local changes
Command:
```bash
git stash
```

Result:
All uncommitted changes were saved to the stash and the working directory became clean.

---

Step 3: Pull latest changes from remote
Command:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

Issue Encountered:
The pull initially failed due to an upstream branch mismatch. The correct remote branch was identified using:
git branch -r

After correcting the branch reference, the pull completed successfully.

---

Step 4: Reapply stashed changes
Command:
```bash
git stash apply
```

Result:
The previously stashed changes were restored on top of the updated codebase without any conflicts.

---

Final Outcome:
The stash workflow allowed local uncommitted work to be temporarily saved, remote changes to be pulled safely, and the local work to be restored without data loss or conflicts.
